      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">1.) How does our water supply get polluted?</a></dt>
        <dd>When the mechanic washes his hands, the chemicals that are present will flow to the river. When you flush the toilet, the water will flow to the rivers. 30% to 90% of the medicines we take will be discharged to the toilet be discharge to the toilet bowls as well and it ends up in the river. Basically most of the man made chemicals end up in the rivers and 97% of over drinking water comes from rivers and that is why our tap water is filled with chemicals. Every year millions of mobile phone batteries are discarded. If they are not disposed off properly they may contaminate our drinking water. One battery can render 600,000 litres of water undrinkable.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">2.) What is distilled water mainly used for?</a></dt>
        <dd>Distilled water is use for many things. The first thing that comes to mind is for car batteries. The chemicals and inorganic minerals will shorten the lifespan of the batteries. Intravenous dripping, medicines, sterilizing equipments, preparation of injections and medicines all use distilled water. High tech manufacturing like computer chips use distilled water. Forensic and laboratories all use distilled water. Then they are those who just drink distilled water just because it is the only water that is virtually free from contaminants..</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">3.) What do you mean harmful minerals in the water? I thought we need minerals in the water?</a></dt>
        <dd>We all need minerals and obtain minerals from our foods. Rainwater has no minerals, but as they fall to the ground it dissolves the minerals from the ground and the ground has about 16 minerals. Iron is used to make iron products and calcium to make cement due to the hardening properties. When inorganic calcium gets into our heart and arteries, we would have high risk of heart disease. When it gets into our kidney, we would have kidney stones. When our tiny capillaries or veins are blocked by these, we would slowly lose the function of the organs due to blockage.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">4.) What are some of the unseen chemicals that exists and the side effects?</a></dt>
        <dd>According to scientist in America (I do not have the statistic in Malaysia) there are approximately 75,000 chemicals in their water. Pesticides, herbicides, chlorine, petroleum and its by products are related to cancer. Male Leopard frogs that are exposed to weed killers developed eggs and ovaries. Fishes exposed to certain chemicals in to Potomac River in Washington are born sexless. In addition to that, inorganic minerals in the water are very damaging to our health. Calcium carbonate which is use to manufacture cement is the principle trouble maker for hardening of our arteries and veins. When our veins to our eyes and ears are clogged by inorganic minerals we will slowing lose our eyesight and hearing.</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">5.) Why canâ€™t these contaminants be removed using normal water filters?</a></dt>
        <dd>It is a scientific fact that chemicals dissolved in the water cannot be removed by filters. When water passes through the pores of the filters, so will the chemicals. How can filter determines what is water and what is chemicals so that it will only allow water to pass through?</dd>
      </div>
      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">6.) If pure water is that important to our health, where are the diseases so rampant when so many of the Malaysian households are using filters?</a></dt>
        <dd>That is the problem itself, many people feel that they are drinking pure water after installing filters at home. You see, filters are not effective in removing chemicals in the water and especially the harmful inorganic minerals. Filters may remove some of the mud in the water and this lead us to believe that the water is pure when in-fact most of the chemicals are still present in the water. How many of thousands of chemicals can filters remove in the few seconds that it takes the water to pass through? Filtered water can be more harmful than tap water as it is a good breeding ground for bacteria. At a certain stage when the filter is filled up with contaminants, the water that comes out of the filter will contain more contaminants than the tap water.

      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">7.) What other diseases can it cure and how can it prolong your life?</a></dt>
        <dd>Distillation is effective in removing chemical and contaminants in our drinking water that are related to many diseases. By removing the contaminants that are related to diseases, we have removed the cause of diseases. When we remove the causes of diseases, the body may heal itself. The body itself is a miracle. People who lost their both of their limbs and legs who survived is an indication of how fantastic it curing properties are. The body immune system however, can be comprised if we were to consume the thousands of toxic chemicals found in our water. These chemicals consumed on a daily basis over a period of time can be detrimental to our health. When bacteria enter our body, it will produce white blood cells to combat the bacteria. The body may fail to produce white blood cells if foreign chemicals are present. Inorganic minerals that can clog up our arteries and veins and harden arteries is also very hazardous. Dr. Norman Walker wrote: "Billion have died drinking regular water died prematurely without any body realizing the lime in the water is the culprit. When you remove the harmful contaminants that can cause diseases, you will live a healthier and longer life.

      <div class="faq">
        <dt><a href="#">8.) What new research has been done to extol its benefits in modern times?</a></dt>
        <dd>We all benefit from distilled water as we all use products that are manufactured using distilled water on a daily basis. All medicines, injections, intravenous drips, forensic department, laboratories use distilled water. Surgical gloves manufacture use distilled water to wash the gloves before it is packed. Distilled water is used as it is the only water that is virtually free of chemicals. The International Space Station and the former Mir station for Russia used distilled water as this is the most efficient system in purifying water. The U.S. navy ships are equipped with distillers. The MV Star Princess has two distilling plants each capable of producing 92,500 gallons of water per day. Many cancer patients use distilled water.
